## About Me

I develop Full Stack applications for the users to consume and use actionable data to make better decisions and automate repetitive tasks. To make a scalable, securable, maintainable, and usable application, I enjoy collaborating with other professionals, including, but not limited to data scientist, system engineer, and UX/UI designer.

In my spare time, I experiment and develop with new technologies. These technologies include Linux OS, cloud services, Amazon web services, containers, and related web driven solutions.
